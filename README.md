# 2N2-40-plusplus
This is very much an "alpha" level project. Proceed only if you want to get your hands dirty :)
Arduino software for the KU4QO version of K8IQY's 2n2-40 transceiver 
This is a work-in-progress. 
*VFO Program to run 2N2-40++ digital Transceiver - Press and hold enter on power up to start calibration
*swap pins XMIT_PWR and ENTER_BTN (D2 and D13) on digital board!
*si5351 clock 0 is vfo frequency, clock 1 is bfo frequency, clock 2 is transmit frequency; clock 0 is 
*temporarily used for calibrating the 25 MHz si5351 clock during the clock calibration routine.
*This version uses a Nokia 5110 LCD display.  Calibration routines use the enter button to advance.
